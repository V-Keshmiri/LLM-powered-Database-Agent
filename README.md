# LLM-powered Database Agent

This project demonstrates the development of a cutting-edge, production-ready database agent powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The agent is designed to handle complex, multi-layered no-SQL databases, ensuring scalable, secure data retrieval and efficient management of unstructured user data.

## Features

- Robust retrieval algorithms for multi-layered no-SQL databases
- Integration of LLM for enhanced user-specific data retrieval
- Handling of unstructured data, including text, audio, and vision
- Dynamic, context-aware data fetching
- Scalable solutions adapting to varying database schemas
- Compliance and security standards for production deployment

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries: `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/llm-database-agent.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd llm-database-agent
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the main application:
```sh
python src/main.py
```
